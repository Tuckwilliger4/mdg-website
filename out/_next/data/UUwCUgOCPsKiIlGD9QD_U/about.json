McKim. Since then we have followed a “general-practice” business model providing design and management services in all sectors of the industry including residential, commercial, tenant improvement, restaurant, civic, K-12 educational, and post-secondary educational sectors.<br><br>Our project experience range from as small as school restroom remodels, as complex and environmentally conscious as the LEED GOLD certified City Hall for Rohnert Park, and as large as full campus modernizations and new schools. McKim Design Group endeavors to provide a professional yet enjoyable atmosphere that extends from its staff and office to every project they undertake. We find that because of the time and energy the entire team and owners invest, the process must not only be successful but fun."},"stats":[{"stat":"14+","desc":"local K-12 school districts that we have worked with"},{"stat":"85%","desc":"of our customers are repeat clients"},{"stat":"16+","desc":"residential neighborhoods in which we have worked"}],"valueSlides":[{"word":"Personal","caption":"Our role is to fit your needs."},{"word":"Engagement","caption":"We work side by side collaboratively with our clients."},{"word":"Matters","caption":"Big or small your project matters to us."}],"leadership":[{"name":"Kirk McKim","position":"Principal-in-Charge","bio":"A proven leader with a dynamic career in Architecture spanning over 30 years, Mr. McKim has extensive experience in California with a very diverse clientele and project portfolio. His background working for a large firm specializing in health-care and amusement park projects as well as his private sector experience at a small firm allowed Mr. McKim to assist in opening a local office for a major national firm. Eventually, Mr. McKim missed the hands-on day-to-day interaction with clients and time spent in the practice of architecture that only a small firm can provide. Thus, in 1996 he opened McKim Design Group, a general practice firm focused on complete project management from start to finish with principal involvement throughout all phases of every project.","image":"https://us-west-2.graphassets.com/cmjvpwu1m0r4q06n10z3b5s97/cmjweai335z7d07n2lf7fjr8g"},{"name":"Todd Walter","position":"Project Director","bio":"Mr. Walter has 30 years of experience in all aspects of educational design including programming, feasibility studies, master planning, design, cost-estimating and construction administration.
